# [토이 프로젝트] The Movie DB를 이용한 유사 유튜브 클론
 
## 1. 프로젝트 설명
 The Movie Database의 데이터를 이용해 영화 관련 정보를 볼 수 있는 웹 서비스입니다. 전반적 구조는 유튜브와 유사하게 하면 좀 더 친근하지 않을까 생각해 보았습니다.


## 2. 화면 구성


## 3. 기술적 경험
 - 사용되는 메모리 자원의 감소 등을 위해 `함수형 컴포넌트` 기반의 리액트 개발
 - 코드의 간결성 및 가독성을 위해 useState, useEffect 등과 같은 `리액트 훅`을 사용
 - api 데이터를 빠르게 가져오기 위해 async await의 `비동기 호출` 방식 사용
 - http 서버 통신을 Promise 기반이며 브라우저 호환성이 뛰어난 `axios 라이브러리`를 이용
 - 좀 더 자연스러운 UX를 위해 `React Router` 사용


## 4. 테크 스택
 - FrontEnd : React, VSCode
 - Server : The Movie DB Server
 - DataBase : The Movie DabaBase


## 5. 인프라 구조


## 6. 회고
 강의를 통해 react를 배우고 이를 활용해 서버 통신까지 해 보는 간단한 토이 프로젝트를 해 보면서 리액트 전반에 좀 더 익숙해질 수 있었습니다.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
